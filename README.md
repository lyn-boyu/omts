# **omts**

**omts** is a collection of TypeScript libraries and tools designed to solve common programming problems in a simple, elegant, and efficient way. Inspired by Eastern philosophy, particularly the ancient syllable "Om," **omts** aims for balance and harmony in code and logic.

## üåå **The Inspiration Behind Om**

**Om** is an ancient Sanskrit syllable considered the primordial sound of the universe, symbolizing the origin, spiritual calmness, and harmony of the cosmos. In yoga, meditation, and many Eastern philosophies, **Om** is a sacred sound that represents wholeness, balance, and harmony.

In **omts**, we draw inspiration from **Om**, aiming to achieve similar simplicity and harmony in code design and logic. Our goal is to build a robust yet elegant TypeScript toolset that helps developers write code more efficiently, avoid common errors, and maintain readability and maintainability.

## üíª **The Power of TypeScript**

**ts** is an abbreviation for TypeScript. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that provides static type checking and stronger code structuring, which helps avoid common errors when developing large projects and improves code readability and maintainability.

**omts** focuses on leveraging the powerful features of TypeScript, providing a series of useful libraries and tools specifically designed for common use cases in everyday development, such as foundational data structures, algorithms, and utility functions, helping developers build more reliable and efficient applications.

## üì¶ **Project Structure**

`omts` is a monorepo that contains multiple libraries and tools written in TypeScript. Each package focuses on a specific area, and the design philosophy revolves around simplicity, balance, and efficient programming practices.

### Directory Structure

- `/packages-data-structures/` - Implementations of common data structures (such as linked lists, queues, stacks, trees, graphs, etc.), designed to be simple and easy to use and extend.
- `/packages-algorithms/` - A collection of commonly used algorithms implemented in TypeScript, including sorting, searching, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and more, aimed at improving developer efficiency and code performance.
- `/packages-utils/` - A set of utility functions and helper tools that might be useful in everyday development, helping to simplify code and enhance the development experience.

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

To get started with **omts**, you can clone and install the project by following these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lyn-boyu/omts.git
cd omts
